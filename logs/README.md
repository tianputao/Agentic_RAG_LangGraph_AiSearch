# Logs Directory (It will be realized soon)

This directory contains application logs and debugging information.

## Structure
- `app/` - Application runtime logs
- `*.log` - General log files
- `error.log` - Error logs

## Purpose
- **Development**: Debug application issues
- **Production**: Monitor application health
- **Troubleshooting**: Analyze runtime errors

## Files Created Automatically
- Application logs are created automatically when the app runs
- Log rotation is handled by the logging system
- Old logs may be compressed or archived

## Configuration
Log level and format can be configured via `.env` file:
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=INFO  # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
```
